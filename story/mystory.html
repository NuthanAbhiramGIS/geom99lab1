    <h1> From India to Canada </h1>
    <p> On 3rd of September, 2024, I started my journey from INDIA to CANADA. My first stop was at Chatrapathi Shivaji International airport, Mumbai. I had a layover of 5 hours at Mumbai airport.

        Layover time here was 6 hours and after this, I have boraded for a flight to Toronto Pearson Airport, Toronto, Canada. To reach Canada, I had to travel through 4 different countries and 5 airports. This was one of memorable
        experiences in my life.
